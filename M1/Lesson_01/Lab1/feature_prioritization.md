# Feature Prioritization Matrix

## MUST-HAVE (MVP - Version 1.0)
*Core features needed to solve the primary problem and deliver value*

### 1. **CSV File Upload**
- **Why:** Entry point for user data
- **User Story:** "As a PM, I need to upload my customer reviews CSV so I can analyze it"
- **Risk if excluded:** App is unusable

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis via OpenAI**
- **Why:** Core value proposition - automated sentiment classification
- **User Story:** "As a PM, I need automatic sentiment tagging so I don't manually read 500 reviews"
- **Risk if excluded:** No differentiation from Excel

### 3. **Basic Bar Chart (Sentiment Distribution)**
- **Why:** Quick visual summary is the primary insight
- **User Story:** "As a PM, I need to see sentiment breakdown at a glance for my weekly report"
- **Risk if excluded:** Users can't quickly understand the data

### 4. **Product Filter (Single or Multi-select)**
- **Why:** Enables drill-down analysis by product line
- **User Story:** "As a PM, I need to filter by product so I can identify which items have issues"
- **Risk if excluded:** Can't isolate problem products

### 5. **Filtered Results Table**
- **Why:** Users need to read actual reviews after filtering
- **User Story:** "As a CS rep, I need to see the actual negative reviews so I can contact customers"
- **Risk if excluded:** No way to validate insights or take action
